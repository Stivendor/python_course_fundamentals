# Programming Exercises Course

## Welcome to the Practice Repository!

This repository holds a collection of exercises and examples designed to reinforce fundamental and advanced programming concepts, focusing on **data analysis**, **file handling**, and **code modularity**.

The exercises have been curated and supplemented (some with the assistance of Gemini!) to offer a structured path for learning and practice.

## Course Structure

The content is organized into key directories, each focusing on a specific area of study:

| Directory | Description | Key Focus Topics (Examples) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `the_basics` | Fundamentals of syntax and programming logic. | Variables, data types, operators, conditionals (`if/else`). |
| `file_handling` | Techniques for reading, writing, and manipulating files. | Opening and closing files, common formats (CSV, TXT), exception handling. |
| `files` | Additional exercises or projects involving general file manipulation. | *Similar to `file_handling`, but may include larger projects.* |
| `modules` | Creating and utilizing modules and packages to organize code. | Importing, creating reusable functions, project structure. |
| `data_analysis` | Introduction to cleaning, processing, and analyzing data. | Data structures (lists, dictionaries), data manipulation with Pandas. |

## Core Practice Topics

The goal of these exercises is to master essential programming tools:

* **Loops:** `while` and `for` for iteration.
* **Functions:** Creating and using reusable blocks of code.
* **File Handling:** Reading data from and writing data to files.
* **Basics:** Fundamental syntax and flow control.
