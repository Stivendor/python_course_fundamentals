# Conditionals in Python are used to perform different actions based on certain conditions.
# the most common conditional statements are if, elif, and else.

# Example with age
age = 19
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age == 18:
    print("You just became an adult!")
else:
    print("You are an adult.")

# Example with temperature
temperature = 30
if temperature > 30:
    print("It's a hot day.")
elif temperature < 10:
    print("It's a cold day.")
else:
    print("The weather is nice today.")
